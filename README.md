# Spearmint

Spearmint is a chat room program that was made in Python and also uses elements of web development as well.  
This project was made close to a year ago now, and was finished quite a few months ago by me.  
This project was the first real use of Sockets and Networking with Flask in Python.  
This project was made and developed by ViridianTelamon (Me).
