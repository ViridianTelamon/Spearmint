# Spearmint

Spearmint is a chat room program that was made in Python and it also uses elements of web development for the HTML file as well.  
To run this program just run the Spearmint Python script and also have the Index HTML file open in you Web Browser, then you can you use it.
This project was made close to a year ago now, and was finished quite a few months ago by me.  
This project was the first real use of Sockets and Networking with Flask in Python.  
This project was made and developed by ViridianTelamon (Me).
